# Welcome to Duy's codes. Have a good experience with bunch of templated codes.
Now I was rearrange my folders and files for easier in reading.
It has 2 languages:
+ CPP (almost)
+ Python ([python](./python) + [training](./training))

Used directories are located in [OLD](./OLD)

Almost time, my CP codes are in training. Another folders are for my classes.
